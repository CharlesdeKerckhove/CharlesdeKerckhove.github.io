        <h1>Daniel Kleiner Clothing</h1>
        <p>A WordPress site was designed and developed to sell a client's clothes. He wanted a simple, easy to navigate and the attention needed to be on the quality of the clothes rather than the great prices. Products were displayed along with their given name, price and ability to add to the cart if the stock is available. A mailing list was included if contact with the company was desired for any reason as well as links to all forms of current social media. <br><br>Linking to this, the project expanded my knowledge of social media further than any other. I created an online marketing campaign that spanned across Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Google+ to advertise the brand's new range of clothes. The campaign involved a creative video that highlighted the new Tudor range in an appealing light. I also learnt about programs such as HootSuite to monitor and upload posts to multiple platforms at specified moments. Alongside this, I experimented with StoreYa and Woobox to incorporate external social media platforms into Facebook. The main focus, however, was on the facebook page and gathering the latest updates across to potential customers as well as events, deals or promotional material such as competitions.<br><br>
